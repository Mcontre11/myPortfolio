											<h2> Software Engineer</h2>
										</header>
										<p> 
											My journey has been quite interesting. 
											I started off in social services, I then decided to switch paths to renewable energy.  Now I work in tech. Whatever I do, I do it passionately because I aim to produce helpful and meaningful change to this world. The tech industry has solved various problems. As a software engineer, I understand the value and power of teamwork and will always find a way to support my team, just as I have supported my community in the past. I know that my motivation is to help others, and my multi-disciplinary work experience serves as valuable assets to any company I am a part of.

									<h2> <strong> Recycle Me & Earn </strong> </h2>
									<p> <a href="https://github.com/Mcontre11/RecycleAndEarnOfficial-"><img src="images/RMEportfolio.png"alt="project image" 
										width="400" height="300"></a>
									<div>This application is my idea to create a mobile app where a user can redeem rewards for recycling. The user would need to go to the designated recycle area; this can be seen on the map. Click RME near me Tab to view the map. For domonstration purposes I have put the QR codes on the map. Ideally a person would have to physically be at the RME station, log into their account and scan the QR code on the bin. Then they would scan the item they are recyling and toss it in the bin. Once both scanners have been processed they earn points! The points will have a value in order for users to benefit from this! An additional feature is a table located on the Dashboard Tab. The table displays the items that have been recycled and how many times that particular item was recycled.

Each Barista's name will be shown as well as the customers. Once the order is complete the user will be able to press the complete button or delete it if the order is canceled. Once the complete button is pressed an added feature of a voice will read the completed order for the customer outloud.
